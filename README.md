TestStatusIcon
==============

A small plugin for the IntelliJ Platform to support continuous testing by showing the last test status in the status bar.


Requirements
------------

* Product version 2019.3+


Usage
-----

The plugin shows the status of the last test run, so it is most useful when used with running tests automatically.

To enable auto-test:

* Run all unit tests
* In the 'Run' window, click the 'Toggle'

### IntelliJ

This will run the tests on build, see [2] for further information.

### PyCharm

This will run the tests every x seconds (see Run Settings / Set Auto Test Delay), see [1] for further information.
